# Jadis

Jadis (Just Another Documentation and Instruction Solution) is a simple documentation generation solution.  Unlike the excellent tool, [YARD](http://yardoc.org/), Jadis is for user-facing documentation or for developer documentation that is unconnected to any particular code or codebase.

Jadis provides tools for:

1. Generating *static HTML* with Markdown.
2. Enforcing a navigational structure.
3. Creating and delivering searchable documentation.

Planned improvements include:

1. Versioned documentation.
2. Local, live-reloading server for testing.

## Installation

Run this command to install Jadis:

    $ gem install jadis

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec jadis` to use the gem in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
